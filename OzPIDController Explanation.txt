The Oz PID Controller was created to use PID to control heavy objects, or objects that have a lot of play in the drive mechanism/

The Function of the OzPIDController:

/

The OzPIDController is designed to take the PID input, and a timer, and create a vector of rate information.  This data has a staircase effect
with a stair length of the update period, but it should not be too noticeable with reasonably small update periods (i.e. <50ms).  The LiveWindow
has been updated to accept the different setpoint derivatives according to construction.  While it is not useful, the controller is fully capable
to change the maximum derivative level after construction.  If the user changes the derivative to a lower number, than the setpoint, and rate data is
lost for that derivative level. TODO: THIS IS UNFINISHED
